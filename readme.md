# Red River Gorge
Is one of the best public recreation areas in Kentucky. It's worth the drive!

[Princess Arch](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/helsleyre/cjp34o3z928ld2rn138vlorx8.html?fresh=true&title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiaGVsc2xleXJlIiwiYSI6ImNqcDM0Ym4wdTBlNHQzcnMwdDRmN3FpdWsifQ.4cypf_JwfOAN9YQJnc42Cw#16.2/37.827250/-83.618460/0) is one of the smaller arches in the gorge. This doesn't mean however that is doesnt have a large personality or character. It would be a shame to miss out on the beauty and wonder of this little arch that has the benefit of easy access. Less than a mile from the nearest parking area. The easy trail and great view make this arch well worth the journey.

<h2>Authored by: Richard Helsley</h2>

This map was generated using State GIS data for Kentucky. The generation of our own data namely hill shades. There was also the use of the National List of Arches. We used several [Python Codes](https://github.com/HelsleyRE/rrg/blob/master/Lab-04.ipynb) in order to speed up the work process and to get used to working with python.
